<P>
By now you've been introduced to Web scripting using the three
hot languages of the day: JavaScript, VBScript, and Perl. While
this book attempts to show you the latest, greatest, and neatest
tricks you can pull whether you have server-side capabilities
or not, the various scripting gurus out there are constantly developing
new methods and implementations. Invariably, if you're looking
for something specific and you can't find it within the pages
of the preceding chapters, you'll probably find it on the Web.
<P>
This appendix takes you on a whirlwind tour through Cyberspace,
stopping off at some of the hottest spots for scripting techniques
currently available.
<P>
What you'll find in the following pages is only the tip of the
iceberg. Every site mentioned here can also be conveniently linked
from the companion CD-ROM as well as other sites and resources
that have popped up during the writing of this book. While this
list is by no means comprehensive, it's an excellent place to
start your excursion into Web scripting.
<H2><A NAME="PerlResources"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Perl Resources</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Perl, the oldest scripting language, is a popular choice for server-side
scripting. It was made available as freely distributable software,
and you'll find everything from interpreter updates to sample
scripts to help with your scripting online.

VBScript Resources</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Microsoft, not wanting to have anything on the Internet that doesn't
carry its mark, countered the release of JavaScript with its own
client-side scripting environment: VBScript. An Internet-oriented
extension of its popular Visual Basic, VBScript provides much
of the same functionality as JavaScript, with the additional capability
of integrating ActiveX and OLE controls into the browser architecture.

<I>this </I>is the place to post the announcement.
<H2><A NAME="ActiveXResources"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
ActiveX Resources</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
While VBScript controls Internet Explorer the same way JavaScript
does, ActiveX extends the browser by offering an interface for
the development of plug-in controls that add further functionality.
Because of the nature of ActiveX as a programmer's development
environment, sites catering to it tend to be marketing engines
for a company's programming tools.

<P>
Several sites on the Web serve as a central clearing house for
Internet-related applications. Many of these are being developed
as low-cost shareware by private individuals. Although these sites
address a broader base than Java or JavaScript, they are expanding
their coverage to include Java editors, extended HTML tools, and
so on.

<P>
The Consummate Winsock Software (CWS) list is just as the name
implies: a very complete collection of the best, the latest, the
greatest, and the not so great. Combining a five-star rating system
and a thorough collection of product reviews, including both pro
and con analysis of all products, CWS is an excellent place to
keep up with what's new and different.

<B><A HREF="http://www.tucows.com/">http://www.tucows.com/</A></B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<I>The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software</I> (hence the
acronym), TUCOWS rivals CWS for its completeness and variety of
content. There is naturally some duplication between the two sites,
but one complements the other quite nicely. The most popular software
on the Net is found in both. For the broadest picture of what's
available, it's worth stopping by both.
<P>
Similar to CWS and its &quot;star&quot; rating system (the more
stars, the better the software), TUCOWS has a &quot;cow&quot;
rating system that highlights hot titles. The &quot;five cow&quot;
titles are absolute <I>musts</I>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A HREF="http://www.shareware.com/">http://www.shareware.com/</A></B>

<P>
What started as the Virtual Shareware Library (VSL), this site
has been taken over by c|net central, an online/on-TV source for
the latest breaking information on Internet technology. Although
it doesn't attempt to rate software, it does provide a &quot;top
downloads&quot; list to indicate what Netizens have deemed the
hot products of the moment.
<P>
Unlike CWS and TUCOWS, which link one product to one download
link, shareware. com's download section presents a list of sites
rated by reliability around the world from which you can retrieve
a particular file.

<P>
As said at the beginning of this section, this is by no means
a comprehensive list of all possible places to find scripting
information on the Internet. However, between what's listed here
and additional resources you'll find on the CD-ROM, you'll have
an excellent starting collection of informational sites.
