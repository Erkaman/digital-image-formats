  \label{sec:color-models}

  \subsection{What Is Color?}
  \label{sec:what-color}

  \newcommand{\bluewave}{\ensuremath{\SI{400}{\nano\meter}}}

  Light is composed of tiny particles traveling at different
  wavelengths\index{wavelength} \cite{neider93:_openg_progr_guide}.
  Different colors are light traveling at different wavelengths. For
  example, blue has a wavelength of \bluewave
  \cite{ohlsson99:_digit_bild_kreat}.

  But how do our eyes \textit{see} these light waves? In our eyes,
  there are cells for perceiving three different kinds of wavelengths
  of light: red, blue and green. When these cells absorb red, green or
  blue light, we see color. And when these cells absorb mixed amounts
  of red, blue and green light, we are able to perceive all the other
  possible colors.

  \subsection{RGB}
  \label{sec:rgb}

  Color models\index{color model} are ways of specifying colors
  numerically \cite{fadgi11:color_model}. A very widely used color
  model for representing color in computers is rgb.

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \inputtikz{rgb.tex}
    \caption{The RGB color model}
    \label{fig:rgb}
  \end{figure}

  The RGB color model is based on how our eyes perceive color, which
  we discussed in section \ref{sec:what-color}. As it can be seen in
  figure \ref{fig:rgb}, the colors cyan ,magenta and yellow can be
  achieved by mixing either red, blue and green. Also note that white
  is achieved by mixing all of three colors. Black is represented by
  no light at all. The rest of the colors can be achieved by mixing
  different amounts of red,green and blue.

  The RGB color model is called an additive\index{additive color model}
  because it makes different colors by adding together light.

  The different amounts of red, green and blue in a color, are called
  their respective color channels\index{color channel}.

  \subsection{CMYK}
  \label{sec:cmyk}

  Instead of mixing light,we can spread color out on paper to make all
  the different colors. Doing this, we have created a new color model:
  \textbf{CMYK}. It stands for \textbf{C}yan,
  \textbf{M}agenta, \textbf{Y}ellow and blac\textbf{K}.

  It is subtractive\index{subtractive color model}, meaning that
  instead of adding light, we subtract the light by adding more and
  more ink to the paper.

  \subsection{RGBA}

  But there is actually even more to RGB. There is an extended color
  model of RGB that's called RGBA. In this model, a new channel is
  added: the alpha channel\index{alpha channel}. This new channel
  represents the opacity of a color. Opacity is simply the opposite of
  transparency \cite{porter84_compos_dig_img}.

  Take a good look at figure \ref{fig:alpha}. This figure demonstrates
  how a the color blue gets a lower and lower value of its alpha
  channel until it turns fully transparent. In the leftmost part of
  the image, the color fully has its maximum possible alpha channel
  value, meaning that it's fully visible. On the other hand, the
  leftmost color has its lowest possible alpha value, $0$, and as a
  result is fully transparent.

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \inputtikz{alpha.tex}
    \caption{The color blue with an increasingly lower alpha channel.}
    \label{fig:alpha}
  \end{figure}

  \section{Color Depth}
  \label{sec:color-depth}

  But up until now, I have said nothing about how the computer
  represents these color models.

  \subsection{24-bit Color}
  \label{sec:24-bit-color}

  In the RGB color model, each color is just a combination red,green
  and blue channels. So, let us represent colors as a triple of three
  numbers, like this: \rgbtrip{123}{21}{91}, which is
  \textcolor[RGB]{123,21,91}{this color}.

  An 8-bit number has, as you should be familiar with, only $2^8 =
  256$ possible values. If we assign an 8-bit number to each color
  channel, the total size of a single color will be 24-bits. This way
  of representing color is called 24-bit color. You also refer to
  24-bit colors as having a color depth\index{color depth} of
  24-bits. This is also called the pixel depth\index{pixel depth} of
  the color.

  \newcommand{\selfcolor}[1]{\textcolor{#1}{#1}}

  A full \selfcolor{red} color is represented by the triple \rgbtrip{255}{0}{0}. In
  that case, have a guess at what color is represented by
  \rgbtrip{255}{0}{255}. If haven't guessed it already, please study
  figure \ref{fig:rgb}. As you probably already have guessed, this color
  is \selfcolor{yellow}. And in the same number mixing and matching way, many other
  colors can be represented. See table \ref{tab:color-examples} for
  examples of other color values.

  \begin{table}
    \newcommand{\colorrow}[4]{  \rgbtrip{#1}{#2}{#3} &
      \textcolor[RGB]{#1,#2,#3}{#4} \\}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lr}
      \toprule
      RGB triple & Resulting color \\
      \midrule
      \colorrow{255}{215}{0}{Gold}
      \colorrow{165}{42}{42}{Brown}
      \colorrow{255}{0}{255}{Purple}
      \colorrow{255}{192}{203}{Pink}
      \colorrow{255}{165}{0}{Orange}
      \colorrow{0}{0}{139}{Dark Blue}
      \colorrow{105}{105}{105}{Dim Grey}
      \colorrow{0}{100}{0}{Dark Green}
      \colorrow{205}{92}{92}{Indian Red}
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Colors}
    \label{tab:color-examples}
  \end{table}

  But of course, not all colors can be represented using just
  24 bits. The number of \textit{all} possible colors is infinite. But you can still
  represent an awful lot colors with only 24-bits. How many? Well, every
  color channel can have $256$ different values. There are $3$
  channels. Hence, there are $256^3 = 16777216$ different colors that
  can represented using only 24-bits!

  \newcommand{\rgbaquad}[4]{
    \mbox{(\textcolor{red}{#1},\textcolor{green}{#2},\textcolor{blue}{#3},\textcolor{gray}{#4})}}

  Adding alpha channels to this color representation is trivial, just
  add a fourth channel and 8-bit number. The only real
  difference is that a color will require 32-bits of storage if an
  alpha channel is needed.

  \subsection{Grayscale Color}

  \newcommand{\selfrgbtrip}[3]{\mbox{\textcolor[RGB]{#1,#2,#3}{(#1,#2,#3)}}}
  \newcommand{\selfrgbtripgray}[1]{\selfrgbtrip{#1}{#1}{#1}}

  If every color channel of a RGB color is set to the same value, the
  resulting color will be a grayscale color. Using 24-bit color, we can for example make the following
  grayscales:
  \selfrgbtripgray{100},\selfrgbtripgray{210},\selfrgbtripgray{60}. Using
  24-bits you can really only represent 256 different possible
  grayscale colors because $256$ is how many different values can be
  represented by an 8-bit number. So if we assign each of these RGB
  triples to an 8-bit number, we have thus invented 8-bit
  grayscale\index{8-bit grayscale}! So in this system, the number 80
  would represent the color \selfrgbtripgray{80}, 180 would represent
  \selfrgbtripgray{180}, and so on \cite{puglia00:_handbook_dig_proj}.

  8-bit grayscale means that we have $2^8=256$ different shades of
  gray. This system is actually applicable to any bit count, as is
  demonstrated in table \ref{tab:grayscale}. You will probably meet at least one of
  these grayscale color depths out in the wild.

  \begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \toprule
      Bit count & Possible shades of gray \\
      \midrule
      $2$ & $2^2 = 4$ \\
      $4$ & $2^4 = 16$ \\
      $8$ & $2^8 = 256$ \\
      $16$ & $2^{16} = 65536$ \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Different bit counts of grayscale}
    \label{tab:grayscale}
  \end{table}

  \section{Parsing Color Data}
  \label{sec:parsing-color-data}

  The number $26$ as a 8-bit number could be written as a string of
  ones and zeroes, 00011010. From now on we will refer to such a
  string as a bit pattern\index{bit pattern}.

  Color is specified by bit ranges in numbers of certain
  sizes. So how do we extract these bits? That is what are going to
  discuss in the section.

  \subsection{Grayscale}

  The most trivial color type to parse is grayscale color. Since a
  grayscale color is specified by just one number, there's no need to
  do any parsing. As we discussed before, the number $x$ specifies the
  grayscale color \mbox{($x,x,x$)}. \todo{discuss different bit depths
    of grayscale}

  \subsection{RGB(A) Color}

  Things do however become more interesting when we try to parse RGB
  and RGBA color. There are several bit depths possible for RGB
  color but we'll only be covering some of the most common ones.

  \subsubsection{24-bit color}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    {\huge\textcolor{red}{10001011}\textcolor{green}{01010010}\textcolor{blue}{\fullbyte}
    = \textcolor[HTML]{8B52FF}{purple}}
    \caption{The RGB bit pattern for a purplish color.}
    \label{fig:24-bit-colors-bits}
  \end{figure}

  The number 24-bit \textcolor{red}{1000 1011}\textcolor{green}{0101
    0010}\textcolor{blue}{\fullbyte} represents a purplish color. The
  separate values of the color channels of this number can trivivally
  be pased by reading them byte for byte. Because, remember, the each
  color channel in 24-bit number is stored in a separate
  byte. Algorithm \ref{alg:read-24-bit-rgb} demonstrates how to read
  all the separate color channels.

  \todo{discuss endianess}

  \begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Reading the color channels of RGB 24-bit number.}
    \label{alg:read-24-bit-rgb}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
      \Let{$R$}{\VoidCall{ReadByte}}
      \Let{$G$}{\VoidCall{ReadByte}}
      \Let{$B$}{\VoidCall{ReadByte}}
    \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}

  \subsubsection{32-bit color}

  32-bit color is very much like 24-bit color. But the alpha channel
  can either come before the RGB color values, ARGB\index{ARGB}, or
  they can occur after the RGB color values, RGBA\index{RGBA}. Figure
  \ref{fig:32-bit-colors-bits} shows both the variants. The first one
  is ARGB och the second one RGBA. The separate alpha channel can be
  parsed in the same way the separate color channels are parsed in
  algorithm \ref{alg:read-24-bit-rgb}.

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    {\Large%
      \textcolor{gray}{11110000}%

      \textcolor{green}{01010010}%
      \textcolor{blue}{\fullbyte}%
      \textcolor{gray}{11110000}%
    }

    \caption{The ARGB and RGBA variants of 24-bit color depth. The
      gray color represents the alpha channel }
    \label{fig:32-bit-colors-bits}
  \end{figure}

  \subsubsection{16-bit color}

  Colors can also be stored in 16 bits, but it is relatively
  rare. There are several variants of 16-bit color storage, so we'll
  be covering some of them here.

  \paragraph{TGA version}

  The kind of 16-bit color used in the TGA format is shown in figure
  \ref{fig:tga-16-bit-colors-bits}. It can be trivially parsed as is
  shown in algorithm \ref{alg:read-16-bit-rgb}. What is unsual here is
  that the values of the color channel's are stored in 5-bit number,
  meaning that the maximum value of a color channel in this case is
  $2^5 - 1 = 31$. However, here only one bit is reserved for the alpha
  channel. A better name for this bit would a flag. And what this flag
  is specify whether a color is visible or not.
