\label{cha:preliminaries}

In this chapter, we will establish all the conventions that will be used
throughout his text and explain some basic terms.

\section{Glossary}
\label{sec:glossary}

\begin{description}
\item[binary number] A binary number is simply a number of base 2. For
  example, the number $139$ is represented by the binary number
  \bin{1000\ 1011}, since

  \begin{align*}
   & 1 \cdot 2^7 + 0 \cdot 2^6 + 0 \cdot 2^5 + 0 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^3
   + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = \\
   & 2^7 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = \\
   & 128 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 139
  \end{align*}

  \begin{Exercise}[label={n-to-bin}]
    Rewrite the following numbers on binary form:

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 4
    \item 50
    \item 500
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{Exercise}

  \begin{Exercise}[label={bin-to-n}]
    Convert the following binary numbers to ordinary numbers of base
    10:

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item \bin{1111}
    \item \bin{1000\ 0000}
    \item \bin{1111\ 1110}
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{Exercise}

\item[bit] The separate digits of a binary numbers are often referred
  to as bits. An n-bit number is simply a number with $n$ binary digits.

  \begin{Exercise}[label={n-bits-max-val}]
    What is the maximum value of a n-bit number?  How many different
    possible values can a n-bit number have?
  \end{Exercise}

\item[toggled bit] If we say that a bit is \textit{toggled}, we mean that
  the bit has a value of $1$.

\item[cleared bit] And controversially, if a bit has the value
  $0$, then we say that the bit is \textit{cleared}.

\item[bit counting order] The bit that has the lowest value is
  referred to as bit 0\footnote{This convention is mainly used because
    us programmers like to start counting from $0$ rather than $1$}.
  In the binary number \bin{0100}, bit 0 is cleared( it has the value
  $0$), bit 2 is toggled (it has the value $1$) and the last bit 3 is
  cleared.

\item[lowest bit] Bit 0 will also commonly be referred to as the
  lowest bit.

\item[highest bit] Bit $n-1$ of a n-bit number. In order words, the
  last bit of a binary number. In the number \bin{100} the highest bit
  toggled and the 2 lowest bits are cleared.

  \begin{Exercise}[label={bits-value-order}]
    What are the values of bits 0, 3 and the highest bit in the number
    \bin{01001}?

  \end{Exercise}

\item[byte] A byte is simply a binary number with 8 digits/bits. The
  max value of a byte is $2^8 - 1 = 255$ and there are $2^8 = 256$
  different values that a byte can have. We will often be referring to
  bytes throughout the entire text, since, as we soon shall see, an
  image represented digitally is just a sequence of bytes.

\item[ASCII] A very common text encoding that will be used a lot in
  this text. \ascii is a \mbox{7-bit} encoding and therefore covers
  128 different characters. But \ascii values are for the sake of
  convenience always stored in 8-bit bytes. The entire \ascii table is
  given in table~\ref{tab:ascii-table}\cite{rfc20}. Characters 33--126
  are printable characters. Characters 0--32 are on the other hand
  control characters. These are used to affect how the text is
  processed. \htab(9) is for an ordinary tab while {\acronymstyle
    sp}(32) represents space. However, many of these control
  characters are obsolete and are practically never used. The control
  codes that are actually used in modern files are \nul, \htab,
  \lf,\cret and {\acronymstyle sp} \cite{maini2007digital}.

  The usage of the two special codes \cret and \lf is something that
  we need to further discuss. They are used to start a new line in
  text. But representing newlines turns out to be a surprisingly
  complex issue. In Windows based operating systems, newlines are
  represented by a \crlf; that is, a carriage return, \cret, followed
  by a linefeed, \lf. Unix based operating systems, like Linux and Mac
  OS X, simply uses a line feed, \lf, to represent newlines. But for
  Mac OS version 9 and lower, \cret was
  used\cite{robbins:_common_newline,noria:_under_newlin_oreilly,editor:_end_line_story_rfc,tancig01:_apart_no_more_newline,corporation08:_creat_telep_applic_both_window_linux}.

  If a text file is to be used on only one operating system this will
  never pose a problem. But if the file is to be shared between
  computers running on different operating systems, it will. However,
  this is something that is almost never noticeable to the common
  user. It is really only of importance to programmers who want their
  software to flawlessly run on different operating systems.

  \begin{Exercise}[label={ascii-to-num}]
    Convert the following \ascii characters to their corresponding \ascii
    values:

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item A
    \item n
    \item <
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{Exercise}

  \begin{Exercise}[label={num-to-ascii}]
    Convert the following \ascii values to their corresponding characters:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $35$
    \item $122$
    \item $63$
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{Exercise}

  \begin{Exercise}[label={ascii-uppercase}]

    What is always true for the \ascii values of uppercase characters(A--Z)?

    (Hint: write them out binary)

  \end{Exercise}

  \begin{Exercise}[label={uppercase-conv}]

    How do you convert an uppercase \ascii value to its corresponding
    lower case value? How do you do the reverse transformation,
    lowercase to uppercase?

    (Hint: what number has to be added or subtracted?)

  \end{Exercise}

\item[Hexadecimal] We will also be using the hexadecimal numeral
  system in this text. In hexadecimal the numbers 0--9 are given their
  usual values, while the letters A--F are assigned to the values
  10-15, so that the hexadecimal number \hex{D3} has the value

  \begin{equation*}
   13 \cdot 16^1 + 3 \cdot 16^0 = 13 \cdot 16 + 3 = 208 + 3 = 211
  \end{equation*}

  \begin{Exercise}[label={hex-to-n}]
    Convert the following hexadecimal numbers to ordinary numbers of
    base 10:

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item \hex{23}
    \item \hex{FF}
    \item \hex{AA}
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{Exercise}

  \begin{Exercise}[label={n-to-hex}]
    Convert the following numbers to hexadecimal:

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 3
    \item 46
    \item 189
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{Exercise}


\item[string] A string is simply a sequence of letters in some
  encoding. The most commonly used encoding in this text will be \ascii
  \cite{rfc20}.

\item[C string] String as they are represented in the C programming
  language. In this language, strings are always terminated by the
  \nul character\cite{kernighan1988c}. The \nullm(alternative spelling
  of \nul) character has, as familiar, a value of $0$. This means that
  the string ``eric'' will be represented by the sequence of bytes
  $101,114,105,99, 0$ in the C programming language. This is important
  to know, because in some image formats strings are stored as C
  strings.

  Why the \nullm character at the end of the string even is necessary
  is for rather complex reasons that we will not treat in this text.

\item[file] We are going to be talking a lot about files in this text,
  so it is important that we as early as possible establish a strict
  definition for what a file is. A file is just a sequence of bytes. A
  perfectly valid file could for example consist of the numbers
  $101,114,105,99$. This a file that consists of the single string
  ``eric'', where the letters use \ascii encoding. However, if you
  opened this file in a text editor, say notepad, you would only see
  the letters ``eric'' and not the numbers that represent the
  letters. This is because a text editor is programmed to see all the
  bytes in a file as text. If you on the other hand opened this file
  in a hex viewer, you would see the file for what it truly is: a
  sequence of numbers\footnote{Do note that in a hex viewer these
    numbers are, as is implied by the name, shown as hexadecimal
    numbers}.

  But since a byte can only have 256 different values, the reader may
  wonder how larger numbers are stored in a file. This is simply done
  by combining bytes. Two bytes in a sequence becomes a 16-bit number
  with a maximum value of $2^{16} - 1$. In the same fashion even
  larger numbers can be stored.

\item[offset] When we are talking about an offset we are referring to
  a position in a file. The offset is zero based. When we are talking
  about the number at offset 0 in the file $13,2,1$ we are talking
  about the number $13$. In the same file at the offset $2$, the
  number $1$ can be found.


\item[render] When a program displays an image on the screen this
  process is known as \textit{rendering}. To render an image is to
  display an image on the screen.

\item[display] Synonym for render.

\end{description}

\section{Pseudocode Conventions}

Instead of showing code examples in some random programming language,
we will be using pseudocode to explain the algorithms in this book. This
will keep things as general as possible, and not force the reader into
knowing a specific programming language before reading this text.

The pseudocode will be kept as traditional as possible, but we will
still need to establish several conventions for it, which is what
we are going to do for the rest of the chapter.

\subsection{Typographical Conventions}

\begin{description}
\item[keywords] will use a \textbf{bold} font.
\item[functions] will be signified by \textsc{small caps}.
\item[variables] can noticed by their $\var{cursive\ slant}$.
\end{description}

\subsection{Boolean Operators}
\label{sec:boolean-operators}

To signify the Boolean operators, or logical operators as we will often
also refer them to, we will be using the following symbols:
\begin{samepage}
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\NOT$] logical \textit{not}(table~\ref{tab:log-not-table})
  \item[$\AND$] logical \textit{and}(table~\ref{tab:log-and-table})
  \item[$\OR$] logical \textit{or}(table~\ref{tab:log-or-table})
  \end{description}
\end{samepage}

Logical truth is represented by \True, and falseness is represented by
\False.

\begin{table}
  \subfloat[l][Logical and]{
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $\mathbf{\AND}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\True}$ \\ \hline
    $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ \\ \hline
    $\mathbf{\True}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\True}$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:log-and-table}
    }
  \subfloat[l][Logical or]{
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $\mathbf{\OR}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\True}$ \\ \hline
    $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\False$ & $\True$ \\ \hline
    $\mathbf{\True}$ & $\True$ & $\True$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:log-or-table}

}
\subfloat[l][Logical exclusive or]{
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $\mathbf{\BitXor}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\True}$ \\ \hline
    $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ & $\mathbf{\True}$ \\ \hline
    $\mathbf{\True}$ & $\mathbf{\True}$ & $\mathbf{\False}$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:log-exlusive-or-table}
}

  \subfloat[c][Logical not]{
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    $\mathbf{p}$ & $\mathbf{\NOT p}$ \\ \hline
    $\True$ & $\False$ \\ \hline
    $\False$ & $\True$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:log-not-table}
    }
    \caption{Logical truth tables}
\end{table}

\begin{Exercise}[label={boolean}]
  Are the following expressions \True or \False?

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $\NOT \True \AND \True$
  \item $\NOT \True \OR (\True \AND \NOT \False)$

  \item $(\True \AND \True) \AND (\True \AND \NOT(\False \OR \NOT \True))$

  \end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\subsection{Bitwise Operators}
\label{sec:bitwise-operators}

\subsubsection{Notation}

The bitwise operators will also be used in this text. We will use the
notation introduced in the C programming language\cite{kernighan1988c}
to represent them in pseudocode:


\begin{samepage}
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\BitAnd$] Bitwise and
  \item[$\BitOr$] Bitwise or
  \item[$\BitXor$] Bitwise xor
  \item[$\BitNeg$] Bitwise not
  \item[$\ShiftLeft$] Left bit shift
  \item[$\ShiftRight$] Right bit shift
  \end{description}
\end{samepage}
Notice that we are using $\BitXor$ for representing bitwise
xor rather than the traditional C notation $\AND$. This is due to
the fact that we would otherwise confuse it with logical and, $\AND$.

What follows is a short introduction to the very simple bitwise
operators.

\subsubsection{Bitwise and, or, and xor}

Bitwise and is just like logical and, except for the fact that it
operates on the bit level. Let us for demonstrative consider the
result $22 \BitAnd 12$. Since bitwise and operates on the bit level we
first must convert the two numbers to binary:\mbox{ $\bin{10110}
  \BitAnd \bin{01100}$}. Then the calculation is simply done like
this:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lr}
    & 10110  \\
    $\BitAnd$ & 01100 \\
    \hline
    & 00100 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

So as you can see, the bitwise operators do Boolean logic on the bit
level.

\begin{Exercise}[label={bitand}]

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $2 \BitAnd 1$
  \item $255 \BitAnd 23$
  \item $26 \BitAnd 12$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

Bitwise or is in the same way logical or on the bit level. Let us
perform the former calculation using bitwise or:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lr}
    & 10110  \\
    $\BitOr$ & 01100 \\
    \hline
    & 11110 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{Exercise}[label={bitor}]
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $172 \BitOr 52$
  \item $3 \BitOr 3$
  \item $240 \BitOr 15$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

Bitwise xor on the other hand, operates on bits by using logical
exclusive or. The truth table of logical exclusive or is given in
table~\ref{tab:log-exlusive-or-table}. Using this table, we can easily
understand how bitwise xor works:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lr}
    & 10110  \\
    $\BitXor$ & 01100 \\
    \hline
    & 11010 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{Exercise}[label={bitxor}]
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $10 \BitXor 10$
  \item $12 \BitXor 7$
  \item $48 \BitXor 16$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\subsubsection{Bitwise not}

When dealing with bitwise not, it is important that we consider the
size of the numbers that we are performing the operation on. If for
example $b=10$ and the variable $b$ is of type byte, then it
\textit{must} be of length 8 bits: $b=\bin{0000\ 1010}$. What bitwise not
does, is that it inverts the number so that at all toggled bits get
cleared, and all cleared bits get toggled, so $\BitNeg b = \bin{1111\
0101}$.

Now you should see why it was important that we considered the size of
the number. Had the variable $b$ been of size 4 bits, then $b = \bin{1010}$
and then the end result of the operation $\BitNeg b$ would have been
$\bin{0101}$ instead of $\bin{1111\ 0101}$.

\begin{Exercise}[label={bitnot}]
  What are the values of the following expressions, if all the numbers
  are bytes?

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $\BitNeg 11$
  \item $(\BitNeg 4) \BitXor 4$
  \item $(\BitNeg b) \BitXor b$, for any byte $b$
  \item $(\BitNeg b) \BitOr b$, for any byte $b$
  \item $(\BitNeg b) \BitAnd b$, for any byte $b$
  \end{enumerate}

\end{Exercise}

\subsubsection{Bitwise shifting}

It is also in bitwise shifting important that we consider the size of
the numbers. Bitwise shifting is actually very simple: all the
operation $b \ShiftLeft n$ really does, is that it shifts the bit
pattern in the number $b$ $n$ steps to the left. For the 4-bit number
$\bin{0011}$, this means that $\bin{0011} \ShiftLeft 2 = \bin{1100}$. But what would
have happened if the bit pattern was shifted 3 steps? Then one bit is
going fall of the bit boundary and disappear, so ${0011} \ShiftLeft 3 =
\bin{1000}$.

And bitwise right shifting works in pretty much the same way, expect
for the fact that the bit shifting is done to the right instead of the
left, so $\bin{0110} \ShiftRight 2 = \bin{0001}$.

\begin{Exercise}[label={bit-equiv}]

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $1 \ShiftLeft 0$
  \item $1 \ShiftLeft 1$
  \item $1 \ShiftLeft 2$
  \item $3 \ShiftLeft 1$
  \item $3 \ShiftLeft 2$
  \item $3 \ShiftLeft 3$
  \end{enumerate}

  Can you express the operation $N \ShiftLeft S$, if the condition $S
  \geq 0$ holds, in terms of the arithmetic operators? Exponentiation
  counts as an arithmetic operator in this exercise. Also, you can
  ignore the possibility of bits falling of the bit boundary in this
  exercise.

\end{Exercise}


\subsection{Syntax}

In this section we will discuss the basic syntax of the pseudocode.

\begin{samepagew}
  To assign the value $n$ to the variable $var$, the we use the
  following notation:

\begin{equation*}
  var \gets n
\end{equation*}
\end{samepagew}


To store a sequence of values we will use arrays. If for example the
array $a$ contains the values the $3,1,2$ then to access the first
value of this array, $3$, the syntax $a[0]$ is used. In general, to
access the n:th value of an array you do $a[n-1]$, since the indexes
of arrays are zero-based.

To to go through each value in the array $a$, the syntax demonstrated
in algorithm~\ref{alg:for-each} is used.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption{The for each control structure}
  \label{alg:for-each}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \linecomment{Go through every value $v$ in the
      array $a$. The variable  $v$ is assigned every element in the
      array $a$ in order.}
    \ForEach{$\var{v}$}{$\var{a}$}
    \linecomment{Do something with $a$ here.}
    \EndForEach
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In algorithm~\ref{alg:repeat} the control structure repeat is
demonstrated.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption{The repeat control structure}
  \label{alg:repeat}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Repeatn{$n$}
    \State $\var{actions}$ \Comment{$actions$ are repeated $n$ times.}
    \EndRepeatn
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

For functions, we will be using the traditional syntax;
\Call{Func}{$a,b,c$} means that we are calling the function
\textproc{Func} with the arguments $a$, $b$ and $c$ and that the value
of this expression is the return value of the function. To return a
value from a function the \textbf{return} statement is used.

The function syntax is demonstrated in algorithm~\ref{alg:euclid}. In
this function, Euclid's algorithm is used to calculate the greatest
common divisor of two given numbers.
\cite{cormen2009introduction_to_algo,weisstein:_euclid_algor}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Euclid's algorithm}
  \label{alg:euclid}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}
    \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
    \While{$r\not=0$}
    \State $a\gets b$
    \State $b\gets r$
    \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
    \EndWhile
    \State \textbf{return} $b$
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The for loop allows for iteration with an explicit counter
variable. In algorithm~\ref{alg:forto} the for to loop is used to
count from $1$ to $9$. Note that it in reality counts up to $10$, then
stops. Prematurely terminating a loop is done with the \textbf{break}
statement.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{For to loop}\algohack{}
  \label{alg:forto}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \linecomment{Prints the numbers 1--9}
    \ForTo{$i$}{$1$}{$10$}
    \linecomment{Print the number 1.}
    \EndFor
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Functions}
\label{sec:pseudocode}

We will be dealing with files in many of these algorithms, so we will need
to introduce several functions for handling file operations.

\begin{description}[font=\normalfont]
\item[\VoidCall{ReadByte}] It is assumed from the beginning of the
  algorithm that a file has already been opened for reading. This
  function reads a byte from that file.

\item[\Call{WriteByte}{$\var{byte}$}] At the beginning of every algorithm,
  we also assume that there is a file opened for output. This function
  writes a byte to that file.

\item[\VoidCall{EndOfFileReached}] True if the end the file we are
  reading from have been reached.

\end{description}

\begin{Exercise}[label={getbits}]

  Make a function \Call{getbits}{$b, \var{start}, \var{end}$} that
  extracts the bit pattern of a number $b$ from a starting position to
  a ending position. These positions are be zero-based. Example:

  \begin{equation*}
    \Call{getbits}{80, 4, 6}=5,
  \end{equation*}

  because $80$ is represented
  by the binary number \bin{0101\ 0000} and from the positions 4 to 6
  there is a bit pattern that has a value of $5$(\bin{101}), which is
  what this function was supposed to extract.

  Hint: Use the bitwise operators.

\begin{Answer}[ref={uppercase-conv}]

  You convert an uppercase \ascii value to lowercase by adding $32$ to
  it, since a $-$ A $= 97 - 65 = 32$. To do the reverse transformation,
  you subtract $32$ from the value.

\begin{Answer}[ref={getbits}]

    \linecomment{Calculate the length of the bit pattern}
    \Let{$\var{len}$}{$\var{end} - \var{start} + 1$}

    (\BitNeg 0 \ShiftLeft \var{len}))$
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}

  The answer is given above. We will now explain this function.

  If given the input \Call{getbits}{$80, 4, 6$} how may we calculate
  the value $5$ from this?

  $80$ is represented by the bit pattern \bin{0101\ 0000}. First, we
  will right shift down the pattern $start=4$ steps, $\bin{0101\ 0000}
  \ShiftRight start$, resulting in the bit pattern $\bin{0000\
    0101}$. Now all that remains to be done is that we need to figure
  out how construct the bit pattern \bin{0000\ 0111} from the input
  values. Once we have figured out how to make this pattern, we can
  calculate the proper result:

  \begin{equation*}
   \bin{0000\ 0101} \BitAnd \bin{0000\ 0111} = \bin{101} = 5
  \end{equation*}

  Using bitwise and in this way to extract bit patterns is a common
  idiom in the C programming language.

  The bit pattern we want to construct is $\bin{0000\ 0111}$. We want
  a sequence of $3$ toggled bits from the lowest bit. We can trivially
  calculate the length of this pattern as

  \begin{equation*}
    end - start + 1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3
  \end{equation*}

  $ + 1$ is necessary because the bit positions are zero based.

  We now have the length of the pattern. Now we need to figure out how
  to construct it. The operation $\BitNeg 0$, assuming we are dealing
  with bytes, gets you the pattern $\bin{1111\ 1111}$. Then by
  shifting this pattern $len$ steps to the left, $3 \ShiftLeft
  \bin{1111\ 1111}$, we end up with the value $1111\ 1000$. Now, by
  simply using the bitwise not operation again, $\BitNeg \bin{1111\
    1000}$, we end up with the desired pattern $\bin{0000\ 0111}$.

\end{Answer}
