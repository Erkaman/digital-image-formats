\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{cha:preliminaries}

Before we are ready to talk about loading image files, we first need
know how images are represented in a computer.

\section{Color models}
\label{sec:color-models}

\subsection{RGB}
\label{sec:rgb}

There several models for representing color in a computer, but the
most prominent and popular one is by no doubt \textbf{RGB} \index{RGB}

But to understand the RGB color model, we first need to understand
color to begin with. Color is light moving at different
wavelengths. Different colors have different wavelengths. In our eyes
there are cells for perceiving three different wavelengths of light:
Red, Blue and Green(which is what RGB stands for, if you hadn't guessed
it already). There can also be different amounts of red, blue
and green light absorbed by the cells and the colors and also be
mixed, creating new kinds of colors. \cite{neider93:_openg_progr_guide}

\end{figure}

So the RGB color model relies on the fact that all colors are a
mixture of red,blue and green, as it is demonstrated in figure
\ref{fig:rgb}. White is a mixture of red, blue and green, yellow is
mixture of red and green, and so on. The mixing of different amounts
of colors can conveniently enough be specified in numbers very
easily.

\subsection{Alpha channel}
\label{sec:alpha_chan}

But there is actually even more to RGB. There is an extended color
model of RGB that's called RGBA \index{RGBA}(it is sometimes also
called ARGB \index{ARGB}). In this model a new channel is added: the
alpha channel \index{alpha channel}. This new channel represents the
opacity of a color. Opacity is simply the opposite of transparency.  A
low opacity means that the color in question is transparent,
\todo{clarify this part} and that an other color be can be seen
through it.  \cite{porter84_compos_dig_img}.

\section{Color depth}

But how are RGB and RGBA represented by a computer?
