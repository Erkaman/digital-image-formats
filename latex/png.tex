\section{History}

As I explained in section \ref{sec:gif-history}, the creation of the
PNG was was primarily motivated by the patents encumbering the GIF
format. To solve this problem, a bunch of developers in the graphics
community decided to coorperate on creating a new format. The work
started on 4 January 1995 and already within a week had all of the
major features of the new PNG format been decided. 1 Jul 96 version
1.0 of the PNG specifcation was released:
\cite{boutel:_png_portab_networ_graph_specif_version1}. Following
version 1.0 was version 1.1, on new years eve of 1998:
\cite{boutel:_png_portab_networ_graph_specif_version11}. And the
latest version of the PNG specification that has been released is
version 1.2, which was released in. After these standards, it was
finally standardized by ISO and released as ISO/IEC standard
15948:2004 \cite{iso/eic04:_iso_iec_png,roelofs09:_histor_portab_networ_graph_png_format,roelofs99:_png,roelofs:_portab_networ_graph_main}.
