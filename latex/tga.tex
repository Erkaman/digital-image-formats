\chapter{TGA -- Truevision Graphics Adapter}

  \cite{91:_truev_tga_file_format_specif}

  The whole purpose of this book was to give a good understanding of
  how image formats really work. But we couldn't just have jumped
  right in, we required knowledge of how color is stored digitally and
  how compression algorithms work. Now it's time to put that knowledge
  to good use. \textit{All} the compression algorithms we just covered
  are all used in the image formats we are going to explore. And
  furthermore, the digital color storage model is used extensively in
  image formats.

  Now it's time to explore our real first image format: TGA \index{TGA}. But why TGA of
  all image format? Because the format is an extremely simple one at
  that, yet it is actually videly used in some areas, including games
  and video processing. It has all the parts common to all image
  formats and it even features a very simple compression algoriothm:
  RLE, which was one of the algoriothms we covered in the last
  chapter.
