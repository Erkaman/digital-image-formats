\section{LZ77 and LZSS}
\label{sec:lz77-lzss}

\section{History}

As familiar from section \ref{sec:hist-lzw}, LZ77 was the first of the
two algorithms described by Lempel and Ziv that sparked the family of
dictionary methods. We have partially discussed already LZ78, since
LZW was based on this method so we will in this chapter discuss the
LZ77 method. But we will also discuss LZSS, which is an improvement of
LZ77 that was developed by Storer and Szymanski in 1982.

\section{LZ77}

The following description of the LZ77 algorihtm is based on
\cite{Salomon:2004:DCC,mark1996data_compression_book,mcfadden92:_hackin_data_compr_ziv_lempel}.
