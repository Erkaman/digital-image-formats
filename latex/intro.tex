\section{Sample source code}

Accompanying most chapters are command line demo programs that
demonstrates the techniques discussed in the chapter. These programs
are written in \C because I thinks that language fits the subject of
this book the best. The source of these can be found in the
\path|code| directory. If you know how to use the \verb|make| program
you can easily compile these programs. Otherwise I'll assume that you know how
to compile these programs.

To get instructions of how to use these programs, pass the command
line flag \verb|--help| to them.
