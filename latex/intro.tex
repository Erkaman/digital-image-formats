\section{Sample source code}

Accompanying most chapters are command line demo programs that
demonstrates the techniques discussed in the chapter. These programs
are written in \C because I thinks that language fits the subject of
this book the best. The source of these can be found in the
\path|code| directory. If you know how to use the \verb|make| program
you can easily compile these programs. Otherwise I'll assume that you know how
to compile these programs.

\todo{give a list of which source directories are associated with
  their respective chapter. Put instructions in a textfile on how to
  use the code in each directory. }

To get instructions of how to use these programs, pass the command
line flag \verb|--help| to them.
