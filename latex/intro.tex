\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Sample source code}

Accompanying most chapters are command line demo programs, that demonstrates the
techniques introduced in the chapter. These programs are written in \C
because I thinks this language fits the subject of this book the
first. If you know how to use the \verb|make| program you can easily
compile these. Otherwise I'll assume that you know how to compile
these programs.

To get instructions of how to use these programs, pass the command
line flag \verb|--help| to them.
